''' LINEAR - array/ linkedlist/ stack/ queue/ matrix
    NON-LINEAR - binary tree/ heap/ hash table/ graph
    LINEAR - storing data sequentially
    NON-LINEAR - no sequential style is required

STATIC - Array
DYNAMIC - List, Stack, Queue


LINKED LIST
    EG:- TRAIN

As the name says list of items which are linked with one another is callled as Linked List.

Types:
    1.single
    2.double
    3.circular

data in linked lsit is called as NODE.every node will have two segments.
one is data and another is address.


creating Linked List:--

step1: create the node.
step2: partition the node with two segments data and none.
step3: Add value into the blank node.
step4: mark the node as head.
step5: create the next node by following the above steps.
step6: esatblish the link between forst node and the second node.

Dsiplaying Linked List:--
